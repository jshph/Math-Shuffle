Project for ENGR 10 at Foothill College; different design ideas for software/games that help people with dyslexia.

Download the repo in its entirety and open index.html in browser. In its current state, it is a sliding puzzle in which the tiles are steps to solving an algebra problem. Arrange them correctly to solve the puzzle. Implementation is currently primitive, and of course this would be more useful with complex math problems that necessitate certain approaches.

TODO:
- add dots to sides of tiles to more clearly indicate target arrangement
- animations of tiles - would involve some well-structured css and maybe different object design
